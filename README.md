***Background and Overview***
Tango is a minimal viable product for planning and keeping track of project. It calculates and keeps track of the shortest time that a project can be completed, as well as determines the specific tasks necessary to complete on time in order to prevent delaying the project.

Tango is built on a MERN stack, utilizing the following four technologies, MongoDD, Express, React, and Node.

***Functionality & MVP***
- Users(Project Managers) will be able to create projects that consist on multiple dependent tasks.
- Project Managers will be able to assign other Users (Team Members) to that task
- Team Members will be able to edit the progress of the task and leave notes regarding their progress
- A User splash page will show a few of the Users most recent projects or tasks that they have been assigned
- Each project will have a show page that will present a visual representation of the project in the form of an interactive node tree
- The application will refactor the estimated completion time and the optimal completion path every time a change is detected on the project tree

***Bonus Features***
- Users will be able to message each other through the app

***Technologoes & Challenges***
- The largest chellenge in this project will be to develop the method for calculating the optimal route and displaying that information. We will attempt to incorporate a variation of a Depth First Search to accomplish this.
